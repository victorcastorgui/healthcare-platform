Everhealth is a platform to buy medicine and consult with doctors. There are 4 roles in this platform, user, doctor, admin, and pharmacy admin.

## How to run the project

- Make sure you have node.js installed in your system. It's better to use node v18 because we develop this project with that version of node.
- Run npm install.
- Run the project using npm run dev.

### Notes:

- We use local backend REST API in this project, so it is possible that the project doesn't run accordingly.
- We've already depolyed the project in this link. Please kindly visit this link https://digitalent.games.test.shopee.io/vm3
